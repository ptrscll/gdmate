    """
    Calculate conductive continental geotherm values.

    This function's calculations are based on scripts by John Naliboff and
    equations from a 1986 article by D.S. Chapman. To use these equations,
    this function employs a model of the lithosphere with
    discrete layers of set thicknesses with different radiogenic heat 
    production. Thermal conductivity is assumed to be constant
    at all depths.
    
    This function is designed to be combined with an adiabatic geotherm (which
    can be found using adiab_geotherm()). As such, all temperatures calculated
    for the asthenosphere are set to the LAB (Lithosphere-Asthenosphere
    Boundary) temperature. 

    This function returns the temperatures and heat flows at the boundaries 
    between layers, as well as an array of depths and the temperatures
    calculated for each of those depths.

    Parameters:
        thicknesses: list of ints
            A list of ints representing the thicknesses of lithospheric units
            in units of kilometers (default: [20, 20, 60]). These ints should
            sum to the total thickness of the lithosphere. The first value is
            the thickness of the uppermost lithospheric unit and each
            subsequent value represents the thickness of the next highest
            layer.

        depth: int
            Maximum depth of model (km) (default: 600)

        radiogenic_heat: list of floats    
            A list of floats containing the radiogenic heat production (W/m^3)
            of each lithospheric unit. The list should have same length as 
            thicknesses. (default: [1.e-6, 2.5e-7, 0.])

        surface_t: int           
            Surface temperature (K) (default: 273)

        heat_flow: float
            Surface heat flow (W/m^3) (default: 0.05296)

        thermal_conductivity: float
            Thermal conductivity (W/m*K). This value is assumed to be the same
            for all lithospheric units (default: 2.5)
    
    Returns:
        boundary_temps: Numpy array of floats
            Numpy array containing conductive temperatures (K) at each layer 
            boundary. Values are ordered from least to greatest depth, with
            the first value being the surface temperature and the last value 
            being the temperature at the bottom of the deepest layer. This 
            array has a length one greater than the length of thicknesses.

        boundary_heat_flows: Numpy array of floats
            Numpy array containing heat flows (W/m^3) at each layer boundary.
            Values are ordered from least to greatest depth, with the first
            alue being the surface heat flow and the last value being the heat
            flow at the bottom of the deepest layer. This array has a length
            one greater than the length of thicknesses.

        z: Numpy array of ints
            Numpy array of depths in meters (not kilometers). Depths are spaced
            1000 m apart. Depths start from 0 and end at the maximum depth given
            by the parameter depth.

        cond_temps: Numpy array of floats
            Numpy array of conductive temperatures (K) at each depth given in z.
            First temperature is the surface temperature, last temperature is 
            the temperature at the deepest depth. Temperatures in the
            asthenosphere remain constant.

    Function to calculate adiabatic geotherm using equation 4.254 in

    inputted parameters (which are assumed to be constant throughout the 
    asthenosphere) to calculate an array of adiabatic temperatures for each of
    the inputted depths. 
    
    This function is not meant to predict temperatures in the lithosphere 
    because the formulas it uses only account for adiabatic processes and
    ignore conductive heat transfer.
    
    Parameters:
        z: Numpy array of ints
            Numpy array of depths (in meters). Shallowest depth should be at
            the start of the array; deepest depth should be at the end of the

        depth: int

            depth used in cond_geotherm() and should equal the last value in z

    Function to calculate combined conductive and adiabatic geotherm, based on

    lithosphere is divided into discrete layers with differing radiogenic heat
    production. This function otherwise assumes most other variables (ex:
    thermal conductivity, heat capacity) are constant at all depths.

    This function returns the temperatures and heat flows at the boundaries 
    between layers, as well as an array of depths and the adiabatic, conductive,
    and combined adiabatic and conductive temperatures calculated for each of

    In addition to returning the values discussed above, this function also
    prints out the boundary temperatures and heat flows, the LAB temperature 
    and depth, and the temperature at the maximum depth analyzed by the model. 
    This information can be used to verify that inputted parameters are 
    yielding reasonable results.

    Optionally, this function can also output a graph of the geotherm and save
